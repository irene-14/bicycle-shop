# bicycle-shop



future improvements:
- user experience: display a box on the right of the form showing real time animation of the bycicle, so when you select a piece, a color... you can dynamically see how it turns out.
- for scalability, an approach of a single json file was considered, but For better modularity, flexibility, and future-proofing your application, 2 files were used. This  allow you to scale your application more easily as you add more special pricing rules or parts, and keeps your code cleaner by clearly separating concerns.
